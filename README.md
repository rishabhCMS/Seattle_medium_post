This project was done as a requirement for the Udacity Nano degree program

### to run the NB just fownlad it and use python 3 as the kernel

### dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

### Libraries used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. kepler-gl

## Motivation for the project

My main motivations for analyzing the AirBnb dataset are

1. Which neighbourhoods have the highest number of listings?
2. Which neighbourhoods have the highest mean price per listing?
3. What makes superhosts different?
4. Why there was a fluctuation in the number of available listings over the year?

## Summary of the analysis

1. Most of the listings in Seattle are located in the Central region which happens to be the Downtown and Capital Hill region

2. Magnolia, Queen Anne, Downtown & West Seattle are most expensive neighborhoods.

3. Cheap neighborhoods like Delridge, Northgate, Rainer Valley have higher ratings

4. Number of Available listings dropped because more people were traveling Seattle in April through September
